- ✅ Proper React Hooks ordering (all hooks before conditional returns)
- ✅ Null safety for all properties (wordCount, publisher, etc.)
- ✅ Dynamic greeting based on time of day
- ✅ Responsive layout with gradient background

#### 2. **Modular Component System**
- ✅ `SelectedWordbooksSection` - Manage selected wordbooks
- ✅ `StudyStatsSection` - Visual learning statistics with progress bars
- ✅ `QuickStudySection` - Multiple study mode selection
- ✅ `WordbookSelectionModal` - Multi-select wordbook interface

#### 3. **Type System** (`/src/types/unified-wordbook.ts`)
- ✅ UnifiedWordbook interface with all collection types
- ✅ Safe adapter functions with null checks
- ✅ Complete metadata and progress tracking
- ✅ Utility functions for sorting, searching, grouping

#### 4. **Firebase Integration**
- ✅ UserSettingsService with `updateUserSettings` method
- ✅ Real-time synchronization with UnifiedVocabularyContext
- ✅ Support for selectedWordbooks field in user settings
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Fixed Issues

#### Issue #1: Undefined Publisher Property
- **Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'publisher')`
- **Solution**: Added safe property access in adapter functions
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### Issue #2: React Hooks Order
- **Error**: `Rendered more hooks than during the previous render`
- **Solution**: Moved all hooks before conditional returns
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### Issue #3: Undefined toLocaleString

- **Solution**: Added null safety checks for wordCount: `(wordbook.wordCount || 0)`
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### Issue #4: Missing updateUserSettings
- **Error**: `settingsService.updateUserSettings is not a function`
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive updateUserSettings method
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
