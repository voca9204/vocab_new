# Examples Generation Timeout Fix

## Problem
The examples generation in WordDetailModal was not working because the setTimeout was being cancelled before it could execute.

## Root Cause
The useEffect that sets up the API call timeouts had `fetchingPronunciation`, `generatingExamples`, and `generatingEtymology` in its dependency array. When the parent component called `generateExamples`, it would immediately set `generatingExamples` to true, causing the WordDetailModal to re-render and clear the timeout before it could execute.

## Solution
Removed the state variables from the dependency array since they're not needed for determining whether to set up the timeouts:

```typescript
// Before
}, [word, open, onFetchPronunciation, onGenerateExamples, onGenerateEtymology, 
    fetchingPronunciation, generatingExamples, generatingEtymology])

// After  
}, [word, open, onFetchPronunciation, onGenerateExamples, onGenerateEtymology])
```

Also removed the state checks from the conditions:
```typescript
// Before
const needsExamples = !hasExamples && !!onGenerateExamples && !generatingExamples

// After
const needsExamples = !hasExamples && !!onGenerateExamples
```

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `/tests/test-examples-fix.js` - Browser console test script
- `/tests/e2e/test-examples-generation.spec.ts` - Playwright automated test

## Result
The timeout now executes properly and examples generation is triggered when opening a word modal that lacks examples.
