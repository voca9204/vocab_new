# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Spaced Repetition and Adaptive Difficulty Systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement advanced learning algorithms for spaced repetition and adaptive difficulty in quizzes and exercises.
# Details:
1. Research and implement a spaced repetition algorithm (e.g., SuperMemo 2)
2. Develop a system to track individual word difficulty for each user
3. Create an adaptive quiz generation system based on user performance
4. Implement dynamic adjustment of review intervals
5. Develop a user settings interface for customizing learning preferences
6. Create analytics to measure the effectiveness of the spaced repetition system
7. Implement machine learning models to optimize difficulty adaptation
8. Develop A/B testing framework for algorithm improvements

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test spaced repetition and difficulty adjustment functions
2. Perform integration tests with the quiz system
3. Conduct longitudinal testing to verify long-term effectiveness
4. Test adaptive system with simulated user data
5. Verify correct application of user learning preferences
6. Analyze system performance and learning outcomes
